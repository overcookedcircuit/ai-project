3. An integer score between 1 and 5 if applicable; if not applicable, use 1: It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.

Read the CONTEXT and ANSWER carefully to make an informed decision. Note that ANSWER may contain symbols, which should not negatively affect the evaluation.
